Subject: Reference for {{ candidate.name }}

Hello {{ reference.name }},

My name is {{ hiringManager.name }}. I manage the {{ hiringManager.team }} team at {{ hiringManager.company }} where a former colleague of yours, {{ candidate.name }}, has applied for a role as a {{ candidate.role }}.

I am contacting you because Brian listed you as a reference on his application. Would you please respond with the best times to reach you via phone to provide a reference check for Brian? The number I have for you is {{ reference.phone }}. Please also let me know if that is still the best number to reach you.

Thank you,
{{ hiringManager.name }}
